Review:

        "A Practical Guide to Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux" (which I'll
    refer to as "Fedora and RHEL" for short) explains how to set up, use, and
    understand Linux, with a focus on the Fedora and RHEL distributions. This
    book is daunting in size, but well designed to easily jump to the topics
    that you either need to learn or that pique your interest. In addition to
    a well crafted table of contents, there is a two-page abbreviated contents
    and a two-page "JumpStarts" guide that takes you directly to chapters that
    describe how to setup up a client or server.

        "Fedore and RHEL" starts, as any good Linux book does, with the story
    of Linux, then delves into the nitty gritty of installing Fedora or RHEL
    (complete with hardware recommendations). Next, the book dives into some
    basic linux tools and concepts, like the shell and file directory
    structure. The descriptions of key foundational Linux topics such as
    standard input, standard output, and redirection are excellently done.
    After this we get into core administration concepts such as security, root,
    and setting up a server. I enjoyed learning of security techniques such as
    setting up a chroot jail.  "Fedora and RHEL" then dives into more details
    of setting up different types of servers, like OpenSSH, FTP, and NFS.  The
    book finishes with a thorough introduction to bash and Perl.

        "Fedora and RHEL" does a great job at teaching high level Linux
    concepts along with the tools needed to get many jobs done. I thoroughly
    enjoyed this book, it has equipped me with more Linux skills to tackle my
    day-to-day tasks. I would recommend this book to a Linux system
    administrator, either as a reference or a learning guide, especially if
    they are working with Fedora, RHEL, or CentOS. "Fedora and RHEL" will turn
    Linux newbies into good Linux users and good Linux users into power users.
